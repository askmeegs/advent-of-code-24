PART ONE 

The first search location is a nuclear plant. 
They are dealing with unusual data.  
Each report= 1 line.  
Each character in the report (line) has X "levels" 

Task - figure out which reports (lines) are SAFE 

A safe report must have items all increasing or decreasing 
AND 
Any two adjacent levels must differ by between 1 and 3 (inclusive) 

Return the TOTAL NUMBER of SAFE LEVELS
